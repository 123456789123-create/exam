1.	Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter their name and displays a personalized greeting message. Push this program to a GitHub repository using Git commands from your local system.

Expected Output:
The program should display: "Hello, [User's Name]! Welcome!"
It should be successfully pushed to GitHub from the local machine.
ANS:1. Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and configure Git:
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

2.Create project folder, file andInitialize.
Mkdir local-repo
cd local-repo
git init

# greeting.py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome!")

3. Run locally to verify
Enter your name: Shreya
Hello, Shreya! Welcome!

4.file status and commit
cd local-repo
git status
git add greeting.py
git commit -m "Add greeting program"

5. Create remote repository on GitHub
GitHub → New repository → greeting-program →create (do not initialize with README)    

6. Add remote and push (HTTPS)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/greeting-program.git
git remote –v 		 #To verify remote
git branch       		#To check the branch
git branch -M main	 #To rename the branch
git push origin main	#To push the file or folder into GitHub.

Conclusion: 
We created a Python program to take the user’s name as input and display a personalized greeting. We tested it locally to verify correct input/output functionality.
We initialized a Git repository, committed the code, and pushed it to the main branch on GitHub. This ensured basic user interaction in Python along with proper version control.

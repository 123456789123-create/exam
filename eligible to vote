2.	Develop a Python program on a remote system that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. Clone the program repository to your local system using Git commands.
Expected Output:
The program should display: "You are eligible to vote." Or "You are not eligible to vote. The code should be successfully cloned from the remote repository to the local machine using Git.
ANS: 1.Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and configure Git:
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

2. Create remote repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub→ New repository→ name it vote→ create (Add README).

3. Create new file in github and writing code
Click add file click on create new file write file name as vote.py  Write code in remote commit the changes copy the code URL.

# vote.py
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer for age.")

4.Now clone to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/voting-eligibility.git
cd vote

5. Run locally to verify
Vote.py
Enter your age: 21
You are eligible to vote

Conclusion: We developed a Python program to check voting eligibility based on age using conditional statements. The program was first added to a remote repository on GitHub. We then cloned the repository to a local system and executed the code. This demonstrated both Python decision-making logic and GitHub’s remote-to-local workflow.

3.	Write a Python program to swap the values of two numbers entered by the user. Display the values before and after swapping. Push this program to a GitHub repository using Git commands from your local system.
Expected Output:
The program should display the values of the two numbers before swapping and after swapping. It should be successfully pushed to GitHub from the local machine.

    ANS:  1. Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and configure Git:
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

2. Create project folder & file
Mkdir swap-numbers
cd swap-numbers
git init

# swap.py
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print(f"Before swapping: a = {a}, b = {b}")
a, b = b, a		# Swapping
print(f"After swapping: a = {a}, b = {b}")
  
3. Run locally
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 10
Before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
After swapping: a = 10, b = 5

4.file status and commit
	git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add greeting program"

5. Create remote repository on GitHub
GitHub → New repository → swap-numbers → create (do NOT initialize README)

6. Add remote and push (HTTPS)
# example HTTPS remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/swap-numbers.git
git remote –v   #To verify remote
git branch       		#To check the branch
git branch -M main	#To rename the branch
git push origin main	 #To push the file or folder into GitHub.



Conclusion: We created a Python program to swap two numbers entered by the user, displaying values before and after swapping. We tested it locally to confirm correctness of the swapping logic. We committed the program and pushed it to a GitHub repository under the main branch. The code was version-controlled with Git and pushed to GitHub, enabling proper code tracking and sharing.
